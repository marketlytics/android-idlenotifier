	    What is this application? \n\n
	    This is an application which monitors and sets your phones audio settings according to how you are working on your computer. \n\n\n
	    
	    How do I use this app? \n\n
	    You need to install the Chrome extension (called IdleNotifier) on your computer. The email you authorize needs to match the email 
	    you select on the app. Once you give access, your phone and extension will be linked, allowing it to inform when your computer
	    is idle or busy. \n\n\n
	    
	    How do I know the app is not malicious? \n\n
	    You can review all the source code on Github - just search for marketlytics-idlenotifier. \n\n\n
